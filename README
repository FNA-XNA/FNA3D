About FNA3D
-----------
FNA3D was written to be used for FNA's Graphics namespace. It carries the same
API design as XNA 4.0, with various implementations available at runtime
(including SDL_GPU, OpenGL, and Direct3D). For shaders, we support Direct3D 9
Effect Framework binaries via MojoShader.

Note that while FNA is the main consumer of FNA3D, we do NOT provide separate C#
bindings. If you want to use FNA3D in C#, simply use FNA instead; it's the same
API and can be used entirely by itself without dragging in other dependencies.

Dependencies
------------
FNA3D depends solely on SDL 2.26.0 or newer.
FNA3D never explicitly uses the C runtime.

Building FNA3D
---------------
For *nix platforms, use CMake:

    $ mkdir build/
    $ cd build/
    $ cmake ../
    $ make

For Windows, see the 'visualc/' directory.

For Xbox GDK, see the 'visualc-gdk/' directory.

For iOS/tvOS and macOS universal binaries, see the 'Xcode/' directory.
